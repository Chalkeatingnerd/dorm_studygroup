        Lorem <strong id="child">Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

         * -- bubbling --
         * bubbling and capturing are just a way to define the order in which the eventhandlers occur
         *
         * when `child` is clicked, browser prints out both child and parent results
         *
         * result
         * I am the CHILD
         * I am the PARENT
         *
         * -> this is an example of `bubbling`.
         * at the example above, we go from `child` up to `parent`
         * in this case, bubbling means we start with the inner-most child element and then work up towards the parent
         *
         *
         * when `parent` is clicked, browser only prints out parent result
         * I am the PARENT
         *
         * by default, the third argument of `addEventListener` is set as false.
         * which means we're gonna use bubbling.
